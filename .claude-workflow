# Claude Code Workflow Rules
# This file defines mandatory workflow rules for AI development tasks

## MANDATORY BUILD VERIFICATION
Every code change MUST be followed by successful build verification.

### Required Command
```bash
cd /Users/ryotakatada/ghq/github.com/aiirononeko/bulktrack-ios && xcodebuild -project BulkTrack.xcodeproj -scheme BulkTrack -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' build
```

### Success Criteria
- MUST see "** BUILD SUCCEEDED **" message
- NO compilation errors allowed
- NO task completion without successful build

### Failure Protocol
1. Fix all compilation errors immediately
2. Re-run build verification
3. Repeat until BUILD SUCCEEDED
4. Never skip or bypass this process

## TASK COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS
✅ Code changes implemented
✅ Build verification executed  
✅ BUILD SUCCEEDED confirmed
✅ No compilation errors remain
✅ Task marked complete

## NO EXCEPTIONS
This workflow is mandatory for ALL code modifications, regardless of scope or complexity.
